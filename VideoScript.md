# Basic idea #

The basic idea is to quickly demo ProveIt's major features in a humorous way. We are thinking of doing this as a parody infomercial. The whole video should last 60 seconds or less.

# Possible outline #

  * person shown struggling to edit Wikipedia references
  * "Introducing... ProveIt!"
  * montage of person using ProveIt to do adding, editing, finding tasks
  * concludes with blue "buy now" screen providing URL, contact info, and pointing out that ProveIt is actually free
